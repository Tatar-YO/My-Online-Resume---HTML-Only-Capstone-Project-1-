    <h2>Summary</h2>
    What defines me in a working environment is that I always try my best, through hard work and kindness, to be an asset and not a hindrance to my team, without getting carried away by petty competition, keeping in mind that achieving personal goals comes through achieving team goals. <br>
    I am very passionate when it comes to science, technology and music. I have studied Physics and my aspirations are a career as a programmer and to learn as much about astrophysics and cosmology as possible.
